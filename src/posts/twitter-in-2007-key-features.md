The first big influx of people [signed up to Twitter in March 2007](/p/twitter-in-2007-the-open-platform/), after it became a breakout app at the annual SXSW conference in Austin, Texas. But even web geeks didn't quite know what to make of Twitter. Was it an “[IM/blogging hybrid](/p/022-web20-expo-2007/)," as I described it in June 2007, a month or so after I'd joined. Was it a "[microblogging](/p/the-golden-age-of-microblogging/)" app, like Tumblr, another trendy internet site to launch that year? Or was it "a weird experiment normally found in neuroscience labs," as a colleague of mine said?

Well, in this post I'd like to highlight five key features of Twitter in 2007 — *before* it was christened "social media" and while Web 2.0 was still thought of as an open web paradise.

## 1. “What are you doing?” 

This was the prompt that Twitter users saw throughout 2007. It explains why so many early tweets were about [eating lunch](https://slate.com/technology/2012/07/oldtweets-search-engine-finds-tweets-from-twitter-s-first-year.html). To be fair, nobody knew back then how to do microblogging, the 2007 term for writing short posts — 140 characters or less in Twitter's case. Along with [Facebook](/p/023-microsoft-mix-2007/) and [Flickr](/p/flickr-before-smartphones-and-instagram/), Twitter was literally inventing social media.

## 2. They Weren't Called Tweets

When Twitter first came out, what you posted were simply called "updates."

When Craig Hockenberry created a third-party Twitter client called Twitterrific in December 2006, he started calling updates "twits." Then in early January 2007, Twitter engineer Blaine Cook suggested "tweet":

The next day, Hockenberry changed "twits" to "tweets" in his app. However, it took another year for Twitter to [formally use "tweet"](https://blog.x.com/official/en_us/a/2008/twitterapple.html) in its promotions. So for all of 2007, they were officially just "updates."

## 3. Twitter's API Had 10x Traffic

The API was what encouraged a thousand Twitter apps to bloom. Co-founder Biz Stone said in [September 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20071217090541/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_open_platform_advantage.php): 

> “The API has been arguably the most important, or maybe even inarguably, **the most important thing we’ve done with Twitter**. It has allowed us, first of all, to keep the service very simple and create a simple API so that developers can build on top of our infrastructure and come up with ideas that are way better than our ideas ... So the API, **which has easily 10 times more traffic than the website,** has been really very important to us.”

As you can see, very quickly the API — used to create apps like Twitterrific — became the leading source of Twitter traffic.

*By July 2007, tech blogs like ReadWriteWeb were delving into the increasing number of [third-party Twitter apps](https://web.archive.org/web/20071219162003/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_twitter_apps.php).*

## 4. 40% Used Third-Party Apps

By November 2007, when my ReadWriteWeb colleague Marshall Kirkpatrick published a survey of "the world's most popular Twitter clients," there was a thriving ecosystem built on Twitter's API.

Although about half of respondants used the Twitter website and a further 10% still used IM or txt, third-party tools accounted for about 40% of usage. Not bad, considering this was months before popular apps like TweetDeck and Tweetie were released (both came out in 2008 and were eventually acquired by Twitter).

## 5. Hashtags Were Born in 2007

Hashtags were first proposed on Twitter on August 23, 2007, by Chris Messina, a Silicon Valley product manager. He suggested using the pound (#) symbol to create groups on Twitter.

As Messina tells it, Twitter initially rejected hashtags (later [confirmed by Biz Stone](https://blog.x.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/the-hashtag-at-ten-years-young.html?ref=onemanandhisblog.com)), but over the next year or two the feature slowly gained traction thanks to Messina and his online friends. Twitter formally adopted hashtags as a clickable feature a couple of years later.
