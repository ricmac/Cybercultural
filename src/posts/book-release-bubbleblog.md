I’ve been calling *Bubble Blog* my “Web 2.0 memoir,” but it’s also an internet history book about the rise of digital culture in the 2000's. Certainly, it's the definitive story of the blog I founded, ReadWriteWeb — and some might say it's the definitive story of Web 2.0 itself.

## More Publishing Details

*Bubble Blog* is proudly independently published, but I've also gone to great lengths to make sure this book is as high-quality as any product you'll find in a bookstore. I hired a professional book designer, Kevin Barrett Kane, who has done a superb job as usual (he also worked with me on my previous book, *Presence*). I also hired a professional book editor, Kellie M. Hultgren, who helped immensely. 

If you're curious about what I'll earn from each sale, as an indie publisher, here are those details. Since it's a hefty book (386 pages), the price points I've chosen give me the following estimated profit margins: US$5.63 per paperback, US$6.92 per eBook. I chose to publish directly to Amazon, as that was by far the easiest and most cost efficient method.

Finally, a note on the online serialization of *Bubble Blog*, which [began back in October 2023](/p/bubble-blog-web20-memoir/). I've published [65 installments of the book](/p/roadmap-bubbleblog/) since then, with the remaining two installments (the epilogue) to be posted early next week. If you've followed my Web 2.0 memoir journey throughout the past 14 months, or have just dipped in from time to time when a particular installment has piqued your interest, I hope you will enjoy the final product: the paperback and eBook versions.
