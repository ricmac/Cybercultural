*This post [as it looked in 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20040530135833/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/001825.html).*

Here goes another self-referencing post about blogging. A couple of days ago I clocked up 1 year on this weblog, having started Read/Write Web on 20 April 2003, with an introductory essay called (of course) [The Read/Write Web](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/04/20.html#a1). Looking back on the past 12 months, I have to say that weblogging has done me a world of good. It's been my creative outlet, it woke up my previously-dormant writing genes, I've met a lot of interesting people, my critical thinking has improved and my [INTJ](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html) imagination has prospered.

## Pre-History

Actually my weblogging efforts started more than 2 years ago, in a short-lived weblog called _Modern Web_. I was just getting into reading blogs at that point — Dave Winer's [Scripting News](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.scripting.com/) was one of the first weblogs I read on a regular basis, also a New Zealand site called [Aardvark](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.aardvark.co.nz/). I soon enough discovered that Dave Winer had created a weblogging tool called [Radio Userland](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://radio.userland.com/). So at some stage in March 2002 I downloaded Radio Userland and began to experiment with this new (to me) web publishing form. 

I should mention that I wasn't a newbie in terms of web publishing, as I'd developed a football picks website in the late-90's. It was a dynamic site too, developed using ASP and an Access database. But after a couple of years I gave up the football picks website, because I wanted to do something involving writing. 21 March 2002 was the day I published my first "post" in my new Radio Userland weblog.

*My [first blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/first_blog_post.gif) in Radio Userland in 2002, pre-RWW.*

In those early days I was experimenting and mostly used _Modern Web_ to store quotes and links. I did the occasional paragraph of original thought, but in retrospect not nearly enough. My _About Me_ page in this first incarnation of my weblog described my blogging as "an informal commentary". That is, I was commenting on other peoples content and not truly creating my own content.

I abandoned this first weblog attempt on 31 May 2002 — a little over two months after I started. Something wasn't clicking.

## Read/Write Web is Born

A year later, when my Radio Userland license came up for renewal — I decided to give blogging another go. But this time I was determined to use it to write **original content**. After a bit of thinking, I eventually decided on "Read/Write Web" as the name for my new weblog. I was influenced by Dave Winer's [Two-Way Web](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.thetwowayweb.com/) theory and accompanying website. Also by [Anil Dash's Microcontent Client](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/introducing_the_microcontent_client.php) essay, the [Chandler](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.osafoundation.org/OSAF_Our_Vision.htm) open source PIM (Personal Information Management) project, "next-gen websites" (as I was calling them back then), counterpoint music, XML technologies, and much more. When I was making notes for a domain name to buy, I noted that read/write means:

> "capable of being displayed (read) and modified (written to)" — [Webopedia](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040000/http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/read_write.html)

It was perfect. I bought the domain name and then began to write.

## Highlights Over Past 12 Months

_April 2003:_ My inaugural post was titled [The Read/Write Web](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/04/20.html#a1). It outlined the manifesto I've promoted ever since then: the Web should be read/write, not read-only.

My third post, [RSS - Subscribing to Topics](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/04/28.html#a3), began my fascination with topic-mapping in blogging. 

_May 2003:_ Web browsers were a hot topic for me during this month — [browser/editors](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/05/15.html#a10) (as Tim Berners-Lee originally wanted them to be) and [the future of IE](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/05/29.html#a42).

_June 2003:_ I wrote a series of articles on [The Universal Canvas](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/06/15.html#a50).

_July 2003:_ My first link from an A-List blogger, [Clay Shirky](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.corante.com/many/20030701.shtml#42653), came from this article: [Weblogs should be topic-first, not author-first](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/07/02.html#a74).

Also in July, I coined the phrase [Web of Ideas](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/07/24.html#a84). It conveys a huge part of what the Web means to me — to "discover, create and share ideas". I later used this as the title of, and modus operandi for, [my linkblog](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://ideas.readwriteweb.com/). I wrote a follow-up piece: [Web of Ideas II](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/07/31.html#a87).

_August 2003:_ Two of my favourite posts from the past year are art/technology mixes: [In XML did Kubla Khan - XML as Literature](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/08/07.html#a88) and [The Whiteness of the Whale - the Semantic Web](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/08/09.html#a96). I enjoyed writing these, as they're a blend of my Arty background (I'm an English Lit major) and my techy bent. I must write more like this...

![ReadWriteWeb domain goes live, August 2003](/assets/images/rww-homepage-8aug2003-1280x800.jpg)
*ReadWriteWeb domain goes live, [August 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20030808071643/http://www.readwriteweb.com/).*

Later in August, I wrote up an idea called [Microcontent Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/08/31.html#a106). It was about how to track a conversation that occurs in the comments on someone else's weblog.

_September 2003:_ I converted to a [CSS-based layout](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/09/25.html#a121) using XHTML.

On [30 September](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/09/30.html#a125) I got [my first link from Dave Winer](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://archive.scripting.com/2003/09/30#When:4:59:06AM), which was a big deal to me because he's been a big influence on my read/write philosophy.

_October 2003:_ My post titled [Select Mode: Publisher](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/10/21.html#a134) best represents this month for me. There was a "broadcasting vs conversation" meme going around at the time and the point I was trying to make was that I use my weblog first and foremost as a _publishing medium_.

_November 2003:_ Inspired by [Erik Benson](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://erikbenson.com/), I [signed up for Nanowrimo](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/10/28.html#a138) — an annual contest where participants have to write a 50,000-word novel in 30 days. I proceeded to bore my readers witless throughout November with updates from my novel. However, Nanowrimo was a fantastic experience for me. It was bloody hard work, but to actually [complete a novel](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/gems/nanowrimo_novel_nov03_0.91.pdf) was a big thrill.

_December 2003:_ Apart from recovering from Nanowrimo, I wrote a few posts on [weblog ontologies](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2003/12/13.html#a168) and taxonomies.

_January 2004:_ I came up with a concept called [The Fractal Blogosphere](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2004/01/18.html#a189). Inspired by Sir Tim Berners-Lee's [Fractal Web theory](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2004/01/15.html#a188), it was a proposal for an alternative measurement of blogging to the [Power Law](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html). It got quite a bit of coverage in the blogosphere.

_February 2004:_ I got all excited by the possibilites of [Information Flow](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2004/02/21.html#a205) as a kind of bottom-up Knowledge Management.

_March 2004:_ My most successful post yet, an [interview with Marc Canter](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://www.readwriteweb.com/2004/03/29.html#a218). It got [Slashdotted](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701133310/http://slashdot.org/articles/04/03/30/2333258.shtml?tid=126&tid=185&tid=95), which caused a big spike in hits. But most importantly, it showed I have what it takes to be an 'amateur journalist'. Now I've just got to work out how to get paid for doing it ;-&#41;

## The Future

Content-wise, I can't predict what the future of Read/Write Web holds. That's what makes blogging so exciting! But there may be changes in infrastructure. I'm working on a re-design, with a new CSS layout and possibly a new weblog authoring tool (Movable Type). Stay tuned.
