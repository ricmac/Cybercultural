I’m [Richard MacManus](https://ricmac.org/) (@ricmac), founder of the pioneering tech blog ReadWriteWeb. [Cybercultural](https://cybercultural.com/) is my website and newsletter about **internet history and its impact on our culture**.

I recently finished serializing [my latest book](/p/roadmap-bubbleblog/), "Bubble Blog: From Outsider to Insider in Silicon Valley's Web 2.0 Revolution". It chronicles the rise of the modern internet during the first decade of this century.

I was the founder and Editor-in-Chief of [ReadWriteWeb](https://ricmac.org/career-archive/readwriteweb/) (RWW) from 2003-2012. RWW was ranked among the top 10 blogs in the world, according to Technorati. It was syndicated by The New York Times and eventually acquired by SAY Media.

I also authored **Web Development History** (2020-21), a blog that chronicled the early years of the web from a developer perspective. That site's content has since been [migrated to Cybercultural](/dotcom/).

## Testimonials

"Richard MacManus’ memoir of his experiences running his tech blog, ReadWriteWeb, during the first decade of the 2000s, is a great read. Richard was smart and engaged back then–and still is–so this memoir offers both wonderful retellings about key moments and key people, and an honest look back and appraisal."
[Susan Mernit's newsletter](https://susanmernit.substack.com/p/41-cyb-ai-web-memoirs-and-wintery), February 2024

"I’m greatly enjoying Richard’s look back on those strangely heady days of the post-mortgage-crisis tech bubble that began to take full advantage of gradients, APIs, and that still somewhat new Cloud infrastructure thing."
