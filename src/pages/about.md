## Testimonials

"One of my favorite places on the web is Cybercultural by @ricmac. His recent "exposé" about [Alice Mary Hilton's impact on media theory](/p/cyberculture-alice-mary-hilton/) is a new favorite. Her techno-optimism and humanism resonate with me, particularly as AI blurs the delineation between people and machines. I highly recommend reading it!"  
[Hannah Aubry, Mastodon contributor](https://fosstodon.org/@haubles/114201026549397496), March 2025 

"[Richard MacManus’ memoir](/p/roadmap-bubbleblog/) of his experiences running his tech blog, ReadWriteWeb, during the first decade of the 2000s, is a great read. Richard was smart and engaged back then–and still is–so this memoir offers both wonderful retellings about key moments and key people, and an honest look back and appraisal."  
[Susan Mernit's newsletter](https://susanmernit.substack.com/p/41-cyb-ai-web-memoirs-and-wintery), February 2024

"I’m greatly enjoying Richard’s look back on those strangely heady days of the post-mortgage-crisis tech bubble that began to take full advantage of gradients, APIs, and that still somewhat new Cloud infrastructure thing."  
[Rick Turoczy, Silicon Florist](https://siliconflorist.com/2024/04/09/web-2-0-nostalgia-remembering-marshall-kirkpatricks-early-days-at-readwriteweb/), April 2024

*Note: MacManus also authored WebDevelopmentHistory&#46;com (2020-21), a blog about the early years of the web from a developer perspective. It has since been [migrated to Cybercultural](/dotcom/).*
