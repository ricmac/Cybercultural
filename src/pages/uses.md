This website is custom built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator created and maintained by [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/).

The design of the site is based on a template called [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/). I have since customized the template quite a bit, but I couldn’t have done this without Lene’s excellent project. She was in turn inspired by [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), a site by [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/).

Search is via [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) from [Liam Bigelow](https://github.com/bglw).

Subscriber emails are delivered <a href="https://buttondown.com/ricmac">via Buttondown</a>, an email newsletter product created and maintained by [Justin Duke](https://jmduke.com/). Thanks also to [Jay Cuthrell](https://fudge.org/), whose 11ty + Buttondown formula I adapted for my own use.

The 'Built with Eleventy' animated 88×31 badge in the footer was created by [Chris Burnell](https://chrisburnell.com/note/eleventy-animated-88x31/).

I mostly compose my articles in Markdown using the [Bear app](https://bear.app/). I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to manage the files and code, which are stored both locally and on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/ricmac/). The site is deployed using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and I manage my domain using [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
